Check-in
* A: well, online platform, life sessions mixed in
* Peter: staying away from architecture ;-)

What is fun?
* Parts of C++ are fun
* Look different at coding (learning different approaches)
* Game development is fun


Godot - 2D
* style of interaction with events and functions
* objects are in scene
* gradually typed, only what you need
* can integrate with other IDEs, could use VS Code for code.
* learn the 50 nodes and that is it, only need which node for what to use
* physics engine also in
* can buy graphics


Idea: use dynamic 2D AND sound to investigate a running system
=> not using that for analysis
=> sound is used for teaching, or tone up or down to...


Retro
* Peter: thank you for patience, 
     lot of searching, nice, cumbersome and refreshing
     leaving: thoughtful, refreshed
* A: new approach using collision detection
     enjoyed it
     leaving: refreshed, ready to work on it again
